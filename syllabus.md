# Intro to tello drone (Class 1)
- The purpose of this drone.
- What is it capable of (what is not in contrast).
- Ways to control.
# Safety (Class 1,2)
- propeller protect
- hight limit
- controll range
# Terminalogy
- engine:propeller (Class 1)
- frame (Class 1)
- eletronic components (Class 2)
  - sensors 
  - cpu and motherboard 
  - camera
  - wifi module
# Control
- iphone app (Class 1)
- PC/laptop communication through wifi(Class 2)
- iPad/iphone communication through wifi(Class 3)

## Control theory (Class 2)
- close loop control : self stabling 
- close loop control : thresholding on when to stop moving/rotating 
- open loop control : accepting signals from wifi

# Motions (Class 1)
- takeoff and land
- rotate on z-axis
- move forward/backward/left/right
- flip forward/backward/left/right

# Programming (Class 2 or 3)
- install iSH on ipad
  - install git, nodejs on iSH
- How each motion is programmed
- How can we programme on already programmed motions
  - move in line/circle/square/cross/triangle or 3D shapes
  - pricision is dependent on sensors.

# Playing
## video demo on each of the motions (Class 1)

## indoor (Class 1)
- takeoff and land (both controll and programming)
- rotate on z-axis (both controll and programming)

## indoor (Class 2)
- move forward/backward/left/right (only one step)
- flip forward/backward/left/right (only one step)

## outdoor (Class 3)
- move forward/backward/left/right (with limited range)
- flip forward/backward/left/right (with limited range)
