# How to fly a Tello drone in nodejs
This folder contains the source code for this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShBrDWSeIgU).

## Description
In this programming video we're building a command-line interface in nodejs for interacting with the Tello drone.

Using [dgram](https://nodejs.org/api/dgram.html), we'll create a UDP socket and write the functions that enable us to send and receive messages to the drone, then using [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) we'll create an interface that allows us to continuously send commands to the drone via input. 

At the end, we'll test our program in a funky little demo.

## Requirements

#### Hardware
Own a Tello drone.
